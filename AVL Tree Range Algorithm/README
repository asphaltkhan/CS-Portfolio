Readme for HW3: Life Is ALl About Balance

Afzal Khan, November 13, 2021

Basic Discription:
These folders contain the files to both populate an AVL tree and find the number of nodes that 
lie within a certain range. The input file provides thousands of nodes to populate the tree. The 
AVL tree wil be able to balance itself and find the nodes within a specified range quickly.

Files:
The Wordrange folder contains:
Code Files: wordrange.cpp bst.cpp bst.h
I/O Files: Under folder Tests
Makefile
Pseudo Code File: Scratchpad.pdf

Usage:
In Wordrange folder:
- run 'make'
- ./wordrange <INPUT_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE>

Input/Output:
The input file has the letter 'i' do denote that the following value separated by a sapce must be 
added to the AVL tree. The letter 'r' denotes that the two values follwoing are the upper and lower
range bound respectively.

Sources:
Parsing the input was taken from Professor Seah's linked list exmaple.
Some of the AVL tree building was also adapted from Professor Sesh's in class BST pseudo code.

Range function 
			   The range function was worked on with student Nabil Mohammed (nmohamm5@ucsc.edu) - absolutely NO code was written 
			   and was only drawn and talked about in terms of pseudo code. All proof of such work can be found
			   under the Scratchpad.pdf.
